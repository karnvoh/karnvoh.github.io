Please check my university profile here [UCL Profile Link](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/geography/karn-vohra). 

In my research, I make extensive use of ground- and space-based observations, and state-of-knowledge chemical transport and health risk assessment models to improve our understanding of the influence of air pollution and its sources on atmospheric chemistry and public health and motivate regulatory action. 

In my postdoctoral research in collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Stockholm Environment Institute, I use an atmospheric chemistry model GEOS-Chem and contemporary health risk assessment models to advance the understanding of the influence of oil and gas lifecycle stages on multiple pollutants and health outcomes in the USA.
